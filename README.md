# My list of programs that should exist

It is an inverse awesome list. Please create pull request to remove items you find ;) I would be thankful

Basically stuff I thought that they should be programmed, but nobody had the time for (maybe they were programmed and I did not have the time to find them).

## Sharepoint git remote helper
Sharepoint repositories have version but are unusable. Sth like  https://github.com/Git-Mediawiki/Git-Mediawiki would help.

## HTTP/2 Feedproxy with speculative push support
I wonder if this would speed up my android RSS readers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push

## TLS client certificate based https (reverse) proxy / jump host / muxd
Why do we have such things only for SSH?:  https://github.com/kennylevinsen/sshmuxd

## A universal ssh / ssl / pgp / x509 key management tool (wrapper script)
RSA keys should be interoperable. Why do I need so many different ones? : http://sysmic.org/dotclear/index.php?post/2010/03/24/Convert-keys-betweens-GnuPG,-OpenSsh-and-OpenSSL

## Deeplink handling webextension and Windows
Open URL with X based on pattern. Why does that not exist in a configurable way for Windows (both as a generic webextension and a default handler for windows, where I can specify my routes). This but with central configurability: https://android.jlelse.eu/deep-linking-in-android-46bc61bd9750
