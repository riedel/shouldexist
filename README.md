# My list of Programs that should exist

Basically stuff I thought that they should be programmed, but nobody had the time for (maybe they were programmed and I did not have the time to find them).

It is an inverse awesome list. Please create pull request to remove items you find ;) I would be thankful

## HTTP/2 Feedproxy with speculative push support
I wonder if this would speed up my android RSS readers

## TLS client certificate based https (reverse) proxy / jump host
Why do we have such things only for SSH?

## A universal ssh / ssl / pgp / x509 managment tool / wrapper
RSA keys should be interoperable. Why do I need so many different ones?
